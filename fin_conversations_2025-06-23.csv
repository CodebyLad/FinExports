[User] what is a scroom file

[Fin]  I think you're asking about SCORM files, not ""scroom"" files. 
 SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference Model) is a standard format that allows learning content to be shared between different Learning Management Systems (LMS). SCORM files are typically in.zip format and contain course content that can be imported into or exported from learning platforms like Sana. 
 These files enable: 
 - Seamless integration between different learning platforms 
- Tracking of learner progress, completion status, scores, and time spent 
- Single authentication (no need for additional logins) 
- Centralized content updates 
 In Sana, you can both import external SCORM files and export Sana courses as SCORM files to use in other systems.

[User] i dont understand

[Fin]  A SCORM file is a standardized format (Shareable Content Object Reference Model) that allows learning content to be shared between different Learning Management Systems (LMS). 
 In Sana, SCORM files work as follows: 
 1. SCORM files create a ""shell"" that connects Sana with other learning platforms. 
2. When a learner launches a SCORM course, they're authenticated and can access the content on Sana's servers without additional logins. 
3. As learners progress, Sana sends key information back to the LMS, including completion status, scores, time spent, and pass/fail results. 
 The benefits include: 
 - Seamless integration between platforms 
- Centralized content updates (no need to update files in multiple systems) 
- Single authentication 
- Rich analytics tracking 
 You can both import external SCORM files into Sana and export Sana courses as SCORM files to use elsewhere.

 Programs are ideal for structured learning journeys, blended learning approaches, and when you need to automate content assignment. They offer more advanced features than Paths, including deadline management and customized notifications. 
 For example, Svea Solar used Programs to automate their onboarding process, achieving 100% completion rates while growing from 700 to 1200 employees.

[User] what is a scrom file

[Fin]  SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference Model) is a standard format that allows learning content to be shared between different Learning Management Systems (LMS). 
 A SCORM file is essentially a packaged course that can be: 
 - Exported from one LMS and imported into another 
- Used to migrate courses between different learning platforms 
- Created in Sana and then used in external systems 
 SCORM files work as ""connectors"" that create a shell file (using SCORM 1.2 or 2004 standards) which, when uploaded to your LMS, gives learners immediate access to content while maintaining tracking of completion status, scores, time spent, and pass/fail information. 
 This allows you to deliver Sana's adaptive learning content through your preferred LMS while keeping all the benefits of Sana's platform.
